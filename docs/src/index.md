## What is JuliaPkg_myTemplate?

[JuliaPkg_myTemplate](https://github.com/mvanzulli/JuliaPkg_myTemplate.jl) is a minimal package for reading [GMSH](https://gmsh.info/) mesh files. The input files are assumed to be given by the msh version 4.1 format, explained in [this web](https://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#MSH-file-format). 

The goal of this package is to obtain nodal coordinates and element connectivities, as well as physical properties assigned to each element.
